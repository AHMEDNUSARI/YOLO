Overview

This repository contains Python codes developed for the detection of accident vehicles using various YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithms. The main objective of this project is to build a reliable and accurate solution for detecting accident-related vehicles in images and videos by leveraging the advanced capabilities of deep learning models.

Project Description

The repository includes implementations for multiple versions of the YOLO algorithm, including YOLOv6, YOLOv7, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLONAS. These models have been trained on a custom dataset specifically designed for accident vehicle detection. Each YOLO version has been configured and fine-tuned to handle complex scenarios such as multi-class vehicle detection, varying lighting conditions, partial occlusions, and diverse accident scenes.


Features
Multiple YOLO Versions: This project explores the capabilities of several YOLO versions—YOLOv6, YOLOv7, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLONAS—to provide a comprehensive comparison and analysis of their performance in accident detection tasks.
Data Preprocessing: Includes data preprocessing steps like augmentation, resizing, and normalization to ensure robust performance across different environments and vehicle types.
Evaluation Metrics: Uses metrics such as mAP (mean Average Precision), precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance and compare results between different YOLO versions.
Real-Time Detection: The code supports real-time detection on video streams, making it ideal for deploying in surveillance systems for automatic accident detection and alerting.
